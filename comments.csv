"i will never understand why people who have naturally beautiful voices allow producers to edit their voices so heavily.  i can&#39;t even understand the words behind all the filters. good song, but it&#39;s gotta be at least twice as good acoustic."

"who is here after espresso and please please please???😅😅😅<br><br>edit: my goodness!!!!! i never expected that i would get 5.2k likes.😂😂😂 anyways, thanks for the likes, guys.❤❤❤"
i hope she gets a grammy for best new artist
why they can be both beautyful and handsome in one person
she’s grown so much in a year.. glad to see she is still going strong 💪
"to anybody who&#39;s reading this, i pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. may the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind. may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life. 🙏"
she really is underrated tbh.
is the vaping being a major feature a brand deal with a specific sponsor?
the boy with a cup is sabrina lol
person 1- i like blue raspberry<br>person2- i like berry<br>me-~inhales oxygen~
"the beat and her flow, damn, this shit slaps fr 😂"

“♥️bbc said i should keep it pg✌🏻…bbc wish i had it in me🫦…there’s a double meaning if you dig deep🔪“🎸🔥
lmfao whys she vaping
wow love this♡♡❤
i love this song it&#39;s so catchy ❤
they said we need to represent every type of woman in this video.<br><br>them: puts a beautiful white and black woman and a white fat woman
2024 anyone?
when i first heard thought itbwas camila cabello
does this girl have a huge head or is it faked?
2024🎉
i listen to this song everyday! ❤️
"wait a minute, are she and he both the same person?"
on repeat saved to playlist liked and commented !
she rly needs to find her own identity and sound. this sounds way too much like an ariana grande b-side
ngl sabrina kinda cute as a boy 😳
it’s the fact that she played herself as a boy and a girl at the same time
nonsense (nelson oliver nespens is surely extinguished nullified and slayed exactly) this is emily bruan of ibm top secret and head of nasa we are governed by the jpl (jewish ped*<b>****</b> league/ovarians/klan(thier original name from 2026 years ago) at the moment via jpl federal orders we took to further an investigation...... donald j trump isaac herzog raganough (these are flags so others get the comments to) all good people are psychics like emily bruan.... we are the order.....
see you at the grammys
"yo, idk about anyone else, but my ears are super sensitive and everytime i hear the knock in the background, my ears flinch and sometimes have looked back. im also 31 male bumping this shit so my roommates can hear it lmao"
bbc i wish i had it in me
she is eye candy
arrasa sempre vidaa
mt minhaa
mt hit até hj
sabrina should change the name of this song to addictive since i can&#39;t stop listening to it &amp; watching the video❤️❤️❤️
it’s the dip shit that he’s wearing
drake flow
"in some part of the video, her voice sounds likes ari. but sabrina is unique 🤍"
i wish sabrina came to perform in sa
"i love how if janice started her song 5 seconds later, she would’ve got hit by the bus just running into the street singing."
let&#39;s take a moment of silence for how this bitch killed music

"i love this song, feather, espresso and thumbs<br>my daughter: omg it’s milo manheim yay i love the zombies film i’ve watched them soooooo many times and can’t wait for zombies 4 🩷❤🩵💙🧡💜💛🖤🩶🤎🤍🌈⚡⭐✨"
her bbc outro was so wild and i love it 💀😭
who came here after she said bbc i which i had in me at her live concert.
she looks twice the age of these boys in this video
for me all this shit sounds the same
desparate to be ariana much?
who is that boy ???? his dimples??? his face???? perfect !!! 😩😩😩🤍
i see minors
funny how none of these b&#39;s dint write any of their songs. but everyones like she almost took this song out. she has no day in ehat goes in her album. trust me.
this is such a twin flame song. cause your twin flame has the same soul as you and they are you and you are them even though you are two ✌people.
that&#39;s whitney peak
fhritp
"i hope you guys to listen to the qur’an, it is will help you to feel happy ❤"
i&#39;m addicted to this song 😭
why go all of the guys there look 12💀
bjjb
hey beautiful how are you doing ❤️
"this is without a doubt the worst music ever recorded.  it’s not even music, she isn’t singing, songs written by ai algorithms, she’ll be cute for 5-6 years then have zero career.  i swear i’m not a “hater” but chic has literally zero talent.  13 year old boys are her only hope,"
i didn&#39;t know that you vape girl lol😂😂😂 but 🇵🇭
i love it ❤👍
it doesn’t look like her tho
either sabrina has a twin or she&#39;s good at green screen
ahh yes.... socks with sandals
horrible song...jesus
first heard this on an edit for the series love to hate you...bomb show and song!
i lov it
i lov this song
am i the only one that hears a drake - god&#39;s plan flow?
🥴 why do i have a crush on the other sabrina
噢不 我居然以為這是另一位歌手唱的，原來我的歌單裡面早就有這首歌了😂
style sounds ari
help i love how she said this song is catchier than chicken pox is-😭😭
i like the fact that the background instrumental is exactly the same as just the two of us
since the album drop i love this bop
keep going
does anyone else get crossroads vibes from the hotel room when britney and her two friends are dancing around in the room drinking after the karaoke part. that’s what i thought about immediately
she really embodies the devil
sabrina carpenter bir kültürdür sen dinlersin dinlemezsin önefmi yoh
better than adele or taylor. you can sing. and you can dance.
why is nobody talking about the hat that says dipshit? 😂😂😂
sabrina playing herself as dude hitting on herself reminds of when taylor swift said you belong with and the other girl was also taylor
i love her feminine vibes
